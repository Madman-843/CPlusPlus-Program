This program allows for the end user to view a clock in both standard time(12 hour) and military time(24 hour).
I think I had it very well organized and handle my if statements well.
I think that adding comments would have enhanced my code significantly and made my intentions more clear. 
The use of methods makes the code much less repeatative and minimizes main
All of the functions made the code much easier to read and easier to update if needed
